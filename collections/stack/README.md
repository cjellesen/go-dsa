# Stacks

A stack is a Last In First Out (FILO) datastructure and can take on different forms depending on its implementation. The implementation in this case will be based on linked lists, this means that append and pop actions are quick (O(1)). However, since the implementation relies on linked lists they will be subject to allocations which will make incure a memory overhead.
