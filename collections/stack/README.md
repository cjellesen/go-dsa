# Stacks

A stack is a first-in-last-out (FILO) datastructure and can take on different forms depending on its implementation.
There will be 2 examples of stack implementations in this repository:
1) A stack based on a linked list
2) A stack based on an array

For stack implementations based on linked lists it holds that these are quick (O(1)) to append to and to pop from (O(1)). However, since the implementation relies on linked lists they will be subject to allocations which will make incure a memory overhead.
